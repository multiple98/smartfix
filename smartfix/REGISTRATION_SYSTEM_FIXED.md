# ✅ Registration System - FIXED AND WORKING

## 🎉 Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The SmartFix registration and email verification system has been successfully fixed and is now working perfectly.

## 🔧 Issues That Were Fixed

### 1. Database Column Mismatch ✅
**Problem:** The registration system was trying to use `username` column, but the database table uses `name` column.

**Solution:** Updated all references to use the correct column name:
- `register.php` - Fixed user insertion and duplicate checking
- `login.php` - Fixed user authentication query
- `EmailVerification.php` - Fixed all user queries
- All verification processes now use `name` instead of `username`

### 2. Registration Process ✅
**Problem:** "Registration failed. Please try again." error

**Solution:** 
- Fixed SQL queries to use correct column names
- Verified database structure compatibility
- Tested complete registration flow
