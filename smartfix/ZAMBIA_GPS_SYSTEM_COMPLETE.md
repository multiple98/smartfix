- **Clickable markers** showing detailed technician information
- **Filtering system** by specialization, status, and rating
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile devices

### 🛡️ Zambia Location Validation
- **Strict boundary enforcement** - only coordinates within Zambia are accepted
- **Province detection** - automatically identifies which Zambian province
- **Nearest city calculation** - shows distance to major Zambian cities
- **Coordinate validation** - prevents invalid or out-of-bounds locations

### 👨‍🔧 Technician Features
- **Detailed profiles** with contact information, specialization, and ratings
- **Service area coverage** showing regions served
- **Performance metrics** including total jobs and customer ratings
- **Real-time status** tracking (online, recently active, offline)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
The system automatically creates required tables, but you can run this manually:

```sql
-- Technician locations table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS technician_locations (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    technician_id INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    latitude DECIMAL(10, 8) NOT NULL,
    longitude DECIMAL(11, 8) NOT NULL,
    accuracy FLOAT,
    last_updated DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_technician_id (technician_id),
    INDEX idx_coordinates (latitude, longitude),
    INDEX idx_last_updated (last_updated)
);
```

### 2. Google Maps API Configuration

1. **Get Google Maps API Key:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable these APIs:
     - Maps JavaScript API
     - Geocoding API
     - Directions API
   - Create API key with domain restrictions

2. **Configure API Key:**
   - Edit `config/maps_config.php`
   - Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your actual key

### 3. Populate Sample Data
