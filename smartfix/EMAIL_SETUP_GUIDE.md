# ðŸ“§ Email Configuration Guide for SmartFix

## Current Status: Development Mode Active

The email verification system is now configured to work in **development mode**, which means:

âœ… **Registration works** - Users can register successfully
âœ… **Tokens are generated** - Verification tokens are created and stored
âœ… **Manual verification** - Verification links are logged for manual testing
âœ… **System is functional** - All features work except automatic email sending

## Development Mode Features

### 1. Debug Email Logging
- All verification emails are logged to `debug_emails.log`
- Contains verification URLs for manual testing
- View at `/dev_email_viewer.php`

### 2. Manual Verification
- Unverified users shown with direct verification links
- Click links to verify accounts manually
- Perfect for development and testing

### 3. Error Handling
- No more mail server errors
- System continues to function normally
- Users can still be verified manually

## Production Email Setup (Optional)

### Option 1: XAMPP Mercury Mail Server
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Click "Config" next to Mercury
3. Configure SMTP settings
4. Start Mercury service

### Option 2: Gmail SMTP (Recommended)
Add to `php.ini`:
```ini
[mail function]
SMTP = smtp.gmail.com
smtp_port = 587
sendmail_from = your-email@gmail.com
auth_username = your-email@gmail.com
auth_password = your-app-password
```

### Option 3: External SMTP Service
- Use services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES
